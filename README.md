# ballgame
A collect-a-thon game where you roll a ball through an open world and collect medals!!! The ball has various abilities that can be used to help exploring and collecting medals. Collect 5 medals to win the game!!
## Compilation Instructions
Be sure you have freeGLUT instaled on your computer, and run the following command to compile the game:
```
g++ main.cpp ball.cpp level.cpp -o game -lglut -lGL -lGLU
```
## Future Improvements
- Keyboard controls for a game where you can move 360 degrees are pretty rough. Being able to use a gamepad to play this game would be ideal
